# metabase_csv_export: Automated Metabase CSV Export 

Using selenium and Firefox Driver, this script finds a metabase question, logs in and downloads it's results as an CSV file. 

After that, it renames the last downloaded file on the destination folder to the question number.

Usage:

    python3 metabase_extractor.py -q https://metabase.example.com/question/1010 -d ~/Documents/Dev/Folder -u your@email.com -p yourpasswd --timer 10  

I made this so I could automate the extraction of a query using Crontabs.
